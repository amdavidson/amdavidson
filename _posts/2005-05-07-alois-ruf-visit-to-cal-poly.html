<p>Well today was one of those top 5 most memorable occurances in my life days... it was absolutely incredible... due to ties with an alumni of Cal Poly Alois Ruf, chief of Ruf Automobiles, came to speak at Cal Poly today. He brought along with him an original prototype CTR1 and a CTR2 and a Turbo R (the CTR2 and the Turbo R were owned by friends of his). I got to get real close up to the cars and they were spectacularly beautiful.</p>
<p>If you look at the gallery of them you can see the picture we snuck where a fiend and I touched the a gasket on the back of the CTR1. We had to get proof that we were there and we <a href="/assets/2005-05-img_0174.jpg">touched</a> them ;-). We were also fortunate enough to speak with Alois one on one and talk about which cars he drives and plans for the Ruf Company.</p>
<p>It was really a once in a lifetime day. I was absolutely awe struck the whole time. ( and i suppose this officially makes this a blog... never planned it that way, but whatever... dont expect other entries if you're reading this, and i know at least someone is.. I've been getting weird hits from Connecticut and other places, not just random pings like the ones that I get from bots in china, these ones actually browse around.)</p>
