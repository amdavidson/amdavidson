<p>Well I just got back from the 2006 SAE Mini Baja competition yesterday and thought that I would post results and pictures from the competition.</p>
<p>We got an 8th overall.</p>
<p>The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design: 7th Place<&#47;li>
<li>Sales: 5th Place<&#47;li>
<li>Acceleration: 3rd Place<&#47;li>
<li>Hill Climb: 1st Place<&#47;li>
<li>Rock Crawl: not good...<&#47;li>
<li>Maneuverability: also, not good...<&#47;li>
<li>Endurance: 7th Place<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Overall, no complaints, there were some good cars there (and some bad ones), and we had<br />
our share of good and bad luck.</p>
