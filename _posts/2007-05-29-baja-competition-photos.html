<p>Photos from this year's Baja SAE competition at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology have been posted. Check em out, I took em with my new Canon Digital Rebel, and some of the shots turned out pretty good, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>We don't have official results from the competition yet, but we don't expect that we did as well as we did last year. We got some great results on the dynamic day, including a &nbsp;spectacular 3rd place overall on the dynamic day and 4th and 5th place finishes in acceleration and, astonishingly enough, rock crawl (with me driving).</p>
<p>Anyways, I'll post some more results as I get them.</p>
