<p>My buddy Mike went out and bought an 2008 Yamaha Raptor 700R. So this last<br />
weekend we took it out to the Pismo Dunes and he had a good time flogging it a<br />
bit. He gave a few of us rides on it as well.</p>
<p>My truck did pretty well too, much better than Ken's Jeep did although not as<br />
well as Sam's FJ-40.</p>
