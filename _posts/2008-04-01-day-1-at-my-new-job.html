<p>I arrived a bit early, despite my the email that indicated that I should avoid<br />
doing so. It wasn't too early and the lobby had already been opened. This was<br />
nice because I was able to get into the line to get my badge picture taken<br />
early, when the line was much shorter. Before long there were 59 "Corporate<br />
Employees" that were here for orientation.</p>
<p>Because there were so many employees orientation was delayed a bit. When the<br />
dust had settled from the all the badge registration we sat down in the<br />
orientation auditorium, and we were greeted by "PC" from the Mac vs. PC<br />
commercials on a large projector screen. He did an amusing little bit about how<br />
we were making a bad decision by working here, and asked us all to leave. The<br />
rest of the orientation covered basic HR stuff, corporate history, security,<br />
and the like.</p>
<p>After orientation I met up with a guy from a related department who had lunch<br />
with me and showed me to my cube where I worked on all the administrative stuff<br />
for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>It wasn't a particularly exciting day material wise, but I was quite excited to<br />
be here, and am rapidly becoming enamored with the culture and peoples'<br />
outlooks here, everything is very positive and energetic.</p>
