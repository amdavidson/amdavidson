<p>Well, it took me about 23 hours from Joy's door to the hotel.</p>
<p>It was tiring, but really not as bad as I was expecting.</p>
<p>I'll just go through it chronologically, for the sake of my memory.</p>
<p>I woke up, went through my normal business, getting ready for the 1030 AM<br />
pickup from the driver, and got a text from United saying that my flight was<br />
going to be delayed. The first nice thing about global services / business<br />
class. So I called my traveling companion Matt and we decided to push our<br />
pickup back to 12 to give ourselves more time at home and less time sitting in<br />
the airport.</p>
<p>So I tooled around the house a little bit more, and sorta got everything<br />
sorted out and was killing time in the back room when Tanya came in and said<br />
that my driver was waiting outside.</p>
<p>At this point I kinda panicked because I had set up my personal cell as my<br />
contact point for the limo company, and had already turned off my personal<br />
cell forgetting that they would likely cal me on it. So I rushed out the door<br />
and into the Lincoln, and did not find out until later that he was waiting<br />
until exactly 12 to knock on my door and I had just run out and into the car<br />
at 1155... That was nice of him to do I suppose, but him waiting and me<br />
feeling bad about him waiting caused me to rush and spend about 4 hours on the<br />
flight going over in my head all the things that I could have forgotten.</p>
<p>No matter though, I got to the airport fine and met up with Matt and got to<br />
skip the <em>huge</em> lines in economy by taking the business class line (second<br />
nice point about business class).</p>
<p>I went into a bookstore at this point to get something to read and bought a<br />
book I tried to read years ago when I was probably 12, but didnt understand it<br />
so I ended up giving up, but I figured I'd give it another shot. The book is<br />
Tom Robbins' Still Life with Woodpecker. Then I hopped in the security line,<br />
and unfortunately at SFO there aren't special lines for business class<br />
(although apparently there are in Shanghai for the way back).</p>
<p>When it came turn for me to head into the metal detector, I wandered through...<br />
BEEP BEEP BEEP... and I realized that I still had my stainless steel watch on,<br />
 which is heavy enough that it <em>had</em> to be the problem and I stepped back and<br />
put it in a bin for XRay... then stepped through again BEEP BEEP BEEP... I had<br />
forgotten the iPhone in my pocket... Dangit!</p>
<p>So two failures at the metal detector led to me getting the whole once over by<br />
the TSA... my whole person was frisked and metal detected more than once, and<br />
each item in my camera bag and briefcase was swabbed with a cloth and then the<br />
cloth was analyzed for any errant chemicals that may have been on them.<br />
Oh well, so Matt went on ahead and wandered the shops while I caught up with<br />
him. We then headed to the Business Class lounge where I munched on the food<br />
that was there in lieu of buying myself a real lunch.</p>
<p>And then we got on the plane.</p>
