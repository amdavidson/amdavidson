<p>Traffic laws are never obeyed here. my cabbie blew by a cop last night passing
on the right the cut him off on the left to get in front of more traffic.
There are people littering the streets, more people than I have ever seen in
my life... It's like the Times Square shot when the kid is lost in New York
and everyone is pushing him into crosswalks that he doesn't want to cross.</p>
<p>Until today, I have been amazed that there aren't constant collisions all over.
I would venture a guess that I spend approximately 15% of my commute back and
forth from the factory driving in the shoulder to pass cars that are driving
slower than the flow of traffic.</p>
<p>However, on my commute to work today, our driver had an "incident". We were
driving down a busy street on our way to getting to the highway for the 20
minute highway ride to work. We left a bit later today being that it is Sunday.
We decided that if we don't get a weekend, we're going to sleep in and leave at
930... Well this decision led to commute during a time when a lot of people are
on the road, or at least thats how it seemed.</p>
<p>As we drove down the street I saw that there were pedestrians crossing the
street back and forth and back and forth, and eventually two of them got
trapped on the dotted yellow line between a VW Santana, a bus, and our
Passat... Well, the man was able to skinny up and squeeze between the cars. The
pregnant woman with him was not so lucky, our driver clipped her with his
mirror and ran over her heel with his tire. He then slowly crept his car for
some distance looking out the back window as they yelled at him. Eventually,
he stopped in the street and left the car and proceeded to yell at the
pedestrians! After much yelling and a beggar approaching them with an empty
bowl outstretched, the driver returned to the car and pulled out his wallet and
handed the man what looked like 200RMB (~$30). What amused me is as soon as the
car was stopped Matt told me that this would be resolved with money and to be
sure that I did not acknowledge that I actually had any on me. He was right on.</p>
