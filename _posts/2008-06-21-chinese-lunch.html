<p>Had lunch on site with the vendor again today. They have a Taiwanese chef they imported that makes the execs lunch each day, and we join them.</p>
<p>They called it Chinese Spaghetti and, for the most part, it was really good. It was like a rice based spaghetti noodle, that we put a Chicken based mixture of vegetables on. That part was all good.</p>
<p>There were additional garnishes that I did and didn't recognize, but this trip, I decided I was going to try it all, and yesterday I did the same and it was all fairly good.</p>
<p>Today however, I put a brown thing on there that looked like a sliced mushroom, but did not taste like one at all.</p>
<p>Missing from my mouth was the earthy mushroom flavor that I expected, and introduced was the delightfully gross taste of kidney from an unknown animal.</p>
<p>Gross, I won't be eating that again. We're going out for Thai tonight, from a restaurant that the vendor assures us is "very plain", so hopefully that means no kidney, liver, gizzard, or whatever.</p>
