<p>So today I had Taiwanese for the first (real) time, it was interesting, thought I'd pass it along like last time.</p>
<p>Today I was daring, tried everything they put on the table. I even ate the bitter melon and clams.</p>
<p>The bitter melon was interesting... There really is no other flavor but bitter. I've never tasted anything like it, and despite me and Ethan trying to find a comparison to make, we were unable. It is a truly unique food.</p>
<p>I actually had to try it twice as I couldn't believe it the first time around. I don't think I'll be ordering it for myself, but it's an experience I recommend to others.</p>
<p>The clams were in the shell and in a soup with asparagus and string beans. They were better than I expected. I'm not usually a clam guy, but I ate a whole bunch of them. Otherwise not too remarkable, it wouldn't even be worth writing if I hadn't been so against clams for so long... Maybe I'll even give clam chowder another try.</p>
<p>Other items on the menu were fine, none too interesting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chicken with Cashews</li>
<li>Eggplant with some sort of fishy sauce</li>
<li>Fish fried in and then crusted with a garlic-y something or another</li>
<li>Goose breast slices that were soaked in wine and served cold</li>
<li>Tofu with peppers and stuff, kinda spicy, not too bad</li>
<li>Solidified Duck Blood and Pig Intestine</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>The usual.</p>
