<p>So I finished the book that I had brought along on this trip, and went to an English bookstore today to get something else to read.</p>
<p>I got "Everything is Illuminated" as I watched the movie and was confused and heard the book was much better and explained a great deal better.</p>
<p>Anyways, what did I see playing on a TV in the "Art" section?</p>
<p>None other than Bob "Happy Trees" Ross</p>

<p>Sorry that I didn't get a better picture, unfortunately as soon as I took this one, that lady in the background came running after me to tell me that no cameras were allowed... Or something that I assume to mean that, after all...<br />
she was speaking Taiwanese.</p>
