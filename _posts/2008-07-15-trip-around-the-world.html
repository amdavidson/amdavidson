<p>So I realized that I haven't posted in a while. So here goes.</p>
<p>I'm currently on a trip around the world, and it's in full steam. I just got to Taiwan last night, and so far I've had some good adventures and brought my camera with me.</p>
<p>Germany was good, we were really stacked with work stuff, but I was able to get out in the early morning and the night to explore a bit.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my last trip there, and enjoyed this one as well. It's a fascinating place, with a lot of true history to enjoy as you wander the streets of little German towns. I found a couple of old cathedrals and town<br />
squares that were fun to explore.</p>
<p>Taiwan is always a sight to see, I had the afternoon off in Taipei, so I went to visit the tallest building in the world. It was quite a sight... The mall below it is only the 'hoity-toity-est' of stores, and after 5 floors of<br />
Cartier, Piaget, Vuitton, and others, you get to an area that lets you head up to the observation deck, which costs like $10 USD but I figured it was worth it, and it certainly was.</p>
<p>The building is amazingly high, over half a kilometer up in the sky, dwarfing anything else in the Taipei skyline. At the top you can see for miles and miles, and there was a lot of cool information about the architecture and<br />
engineering of the building which I enjoyed greatly. (If you click through to the gallery, the big yellow ball thing is a huge mass to dampen the effects of wind on the structure).</p>
<p>Anyways, it was an amazing thing to hop on a plane and leave a country known for its history, and land in a country that is as modern as they get.</p>
