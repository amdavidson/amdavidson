<p>I added some pictures from our labor day trip to Franks Valley.</p>
<p>Had a weekend off in the States and it just happened to coincide with Labor
Day. Taking advantage, we took Friday off and headed up the hill with my
parents to Frank's Valley for a weekend of no email, no cell phones, and
relaxation.</p>
<p>It was a real nice weekend, did a little fishing, gold panning, shooting, and
just general camping stuff.</p>
<p>Check out the pics!</p>
