<p>Got a little bored in my hotel room last night.</p>
<p>Took some shots of the light trails of the cars from my window.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, but I thought it was kinda neat. I had a bit of a time trying
to take it as I had no tripod and this photo was a 30 second long exposure. I
had to stack up nearly everything in my room to try and get a decent camera
angle.</p>
<p>I had another idea for an album as well, and got the chance to take some pics
today. I hope to have a new album together in a couple of days.</p>
