<p>I had some time off on Sunday, and had a concept for an album of images around Taipei.</p>
<p>So I went around and hit a couple areas of town that I thought would work for the images. After I got to the second site, things changed a bit and I started working on a pretty different album.</p>
<p>I'm trying out a few new things in this album. I don't usually head out with an album idea in mind, but I liked it, so I might try it more often.</p>
<p>I also don't usually process images like it, I'm trying out a new over-processed, black and white look. I don't think I'm going to use it all the time, but I kinda like it and might play with it more in the future.</p>
