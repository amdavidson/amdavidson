<p>I've been driving back from the vendor for the last few days seeing Taipei 101
all lit up for the new year.</p>
<p>It seemed like something interesting to take a picture of and I've been
meaning to get out there and do it, but haven't gotten the chance... So here's
a snap from the window of my cab on the way back.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to note in the pic is that "2009" is written on the
building. The official year in Taiwan is <a>98</a> (98 years since the start
of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>When first coming to Taiwan, this actually was quite confusing... A random
batch of six numbers often starting in 97 didn't stand out as a date to me.</p>
<p>Why they chose to put up 2009 on 101 is beyond me.</p>
