<p>I took the day off on MLK day and Naomi and I headed up to SF for something to
do.</p>
<p>After driving around quite a bit with no luck finding parking, we nabbed a
great spot in Golden Gate Park and headed to the <a>California Academy of
Sciences</a> museum.</p>
<p>As we were leaving the rain forest exhibit, Naomi noticed a cool little frog
sitting on the glass, and it was interesting how he tucked his feet underneath
himself. I had never noticed or realized that frogs sit like that.</p>
<p>Not the most photographically rewarding photo, but an interesting shot more
because of the content.</p>
