<p>I was bored in my hotel room in Shenzhen so I did a time lapse video of my watch. It came out kinda interesting, so I'm posting it here. The panning is kinda neat, but in all honesty... it was an artifact of me not using a tripod and not using mirror lockup to prevent camera vibrations... My 40D just kinda shook itself along, but it makes it a bit more interesting. The video is hosted on Vimeo, and if you click here you can see the video in HD.</p>
