<p>Shot a picture of the moon setting over Shenzhen this morning... Smoggy, smoggy morning...</p>
<p>I bought a <a>Gorillapod</a> knock-off and remote shutter release over the weekend, and when I saw the pretty color of the moon over a sky scraper this morning, I had a use for it.</p>
<p>I've never shot in so much haze before, so the photo turned out different that I had hoped it would, but I still thought I'd post something up.</p>
