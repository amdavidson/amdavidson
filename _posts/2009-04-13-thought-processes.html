<p>I have no idea what goes through the head of some people in China. They have thought processes that are totally unfamiliar to me, and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to understand what causes them to do the things they do.</p>
<p>Here goes a story to elaborate on this point...</p>
<p>I spent most of the day in my hotel room yesterday. No particular place to go, so I caught up on some stuff I wanted to get done on the net and video chatted with Naomi.</p>
<p>Well right before I expected Naomi to get home, the housekeeping guy showed up and asked me to clean the room, after realizing he didn't understand "No" I threw out the little Chinese I know with a "Bu Yao" ("No Want") and he got the picture and scrammed.</p>
<p>Later on I headed out to Hua Qiang Bei, the local electronics district, and left the do not disturb sign unlit hoping that when I got back they'd clean up a bit when they come through to do the turn down service.</p>
<p>I returned to realize that this was not the case. The room looked exactly as I had left it, or so I thought.</p>
<p>I had no indication that there was anything amiss until the next morning when I went to hop in the shower and realized that my towel was missing. I'm certain that <b>I</b> did not remove the towel, and searched the room quite extensively to locate any other towels... Settling for a hand towel as my only recourse I proceeded to hop in the shower, only to realize that in addition to my towel, they had taken all my little bottles of shampoo and soap from the shower. There was <i>definitely</i> enough in there for another round or two of bathing so I have no idea why they would have taken it.</p>
<p>What confuses me more, is if you're only going to take the towel and shampoo bottles, why even bother coming in the, admittedly messy, room? I suppose they didn't want to clean up the rest of the room because I had already refused service that day, but why take the towel and shampoo bottles and not replace them?</p>
<p>I may never understand.</p>
