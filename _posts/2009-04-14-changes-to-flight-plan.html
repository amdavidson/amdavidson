<p>Had a surprise change to my flight plan when leaving Shenzhen airport on China Eastern Airlines.</p>
<p>I got to the airport early, as I usually do... I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm not one of those that likes to run to the gate at the last minute. I prefer to take my time, find a little WiFi and relax before my flight.</p>
<p>Well today was not going to be one of those days.</p>
<p>I was sitting in a cafe above my gate relaxing a bit and checking some email, when, on a whim, I checked my ticket to verify the gate info and flight number. To my astonishment, the flight numbers didn't match, and worse, the departure time listed on my ticket was a full hour earlier than the flight I was booked on, and I was already 30 minutes late.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, the flight that I had been changed to was running about 40 minutes late, so I still made it.</p>
<p>It bewilders me why a gate agent would make a change to my itinerary such as this without notifying me of the change so that I could adjust and plan ahead? Especially because the flight was already boarding by the time I got through security and got to the gate. Had I spent any more time just idly walking around I would have never made it.</p>
<p>Thanks trying to help me out with a bump to an earlier itinerary gate agent man, but <i>tell me</i> next time.</p>
