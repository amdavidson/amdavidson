<p>Had a day off in Japan, so I went for a stroll around Shinjuku. Nothing too special, had some lunch, took some photos, but here it is, documented in a <a>Google Map</a>.</p>
<p>If you click <a>through</a> to Google Maps, you can see the list of pins in order. If you're still here though, start where the two closest pins are, and then follow the trail (anti-clockwise), clicking on the dropped pins as you go to see what I did, and any pictures I may have taken. Feel free to click the pictures to get a link to larger ones on <a>Flickr</a>.</p>
