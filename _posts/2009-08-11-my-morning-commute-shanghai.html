<p>I'm a little late posting these, but it's been a crazy week. Here's a continuation of the My Morning Commute photos I took.</p>
<p>The next stop in my travels took me to Shanghai, a city that I've been to but really have only been visiting much recently.</p>

<p>What has always stricken me about the city is it's glaring contrast between the modern world and the city's long history. This photo of a modern skyscraper immediately behind a historic office building is one of several scenes that I have come across that really shows that contrast.</p>

<p>Leaving Shanghai is a completely different contrast. Shanghai is in the top 10 largest cities in the world, but when I leave it, it doesn't seem to trail off the way that other large cities do, into a maze of suburbs. Leaving Shanghai often feels like traveling into another world.</p>

<p>Here's a less interesting, but frequent view that I have from the back of whatever vendor's van I'm in. China's freeway system is comprised of more tollways than anywhere else I've seen yet.</p>
