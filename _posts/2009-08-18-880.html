<p>When I stay in Tokyo, I rarely "stay" in Tokyo long. It's more of a base-of-operations, or more accurate: a place where I leave my suitcase.</p>
<p>I have not yet had a vendor that could actually call themselves, "based in Tokyo" but it's still a major hub and so it ends up being a hub of my travels in Japan.</p>
<p>This commute is not a single day's commute like the other days, instead I'm posting pictures from two days of commuting as they were drastically different.</p>
<p>Day 1:</p>

<p>The first day I had to visit a vendor in Toyama, which unfortunately is difficult to get to by train (mountains in the way). This meant a day flight, not my favorite.</p>
<p>It took me nearly 5 hours to make the 176km flight for a 4 hour meeting and then another 5 hours to get back to the hotel, but that's life.</p>
<p>Day 2:</p>

<p>On the second day, I had to visit a vendor that was outside Niigata, a ways north of Tokyo, but much more easily accessible by train.</p>

<p>To get there, I took the Chue line from Shinjuku to the Tokyo Central Station then the JR Shinkansen up to the Tsubame-Sanjo Station.</p>

<p>And a bonus shot below, of my evening commute back to Shinjuku after a long day...</p>
