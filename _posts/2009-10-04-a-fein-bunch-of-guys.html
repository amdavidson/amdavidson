<p>This past weekend were the nuptials of TJ Guy and Margot Fein. It was a good opportunity to take my camera out after it being in a bag for quite some time.</p>
<p>The wedding was at the Firethorne Country Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. Margot is a native North Carolinan and TJ has been living there for the last few years working for Budweiser.</p>
<p>The Guy family and I flew out a few days early to help with preparations and to be there for all the lead up into the actual wedding Saturday evening.</p>
<p>We flew out early in the morning on inconvenient flight that we bought with points I had on Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles program. I cannot recommend the experience. Flight selection was terrible, customer service was spotty, not very pleasant at all.</p>
<p>But in the end we got to Charlotte fine, and the wedding proceedings commenced without many hiccups.</p>

<p>We had a great rehearsal outdoors, but practiced indoors just in case.</p>

<p>The indoor practice ended up being a good thing, it rained on the wedding day. The wedding went really well, I didn't take many pictures at all, but I did get this good shot of "The Tribe" as Joy calls them.</p>
