<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html">Google reconsidered their stance</a> on China's Great Firewall and decided to un-censor their search results.</p>
<p>I applaud Google on doing the right thing here, even if it does end up meaning losing a valuable marketplace.</p>
<p>However, this means there's going to be yet another thing I need VPN access for when in China.</p>
