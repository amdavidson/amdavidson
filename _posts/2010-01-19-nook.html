<p>I got my Barnes &amp; Noble nook in the mail last night (finally&#8230;). Here are my first impressions.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ergonomics are much better than my Sony Reader.</li>
<li>Page turn speeds not nearly as bad as early reviews said (running v1.1.1 software).</li>
<li>Sony Reader ebooks were easy to side-load</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface is clumsy and awkward.</li>
<li>Heavier in the hand than expected (but not overly heavy).</li><br />
</ul></p>
