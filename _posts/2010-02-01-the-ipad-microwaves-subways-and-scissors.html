<p>This is a great response to all the people complaining about the iPad's lack of &ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I know, it's not everything you dreamed of... but that doesn't mean it's not awesome&hellip; It doesn't come with a keyboard. It doesn't come with a microwave either. And you're going to have to use your own subway to get it back from the store and your own scissors to get it out of the box. O woe! <cite><a href="http://squashed.tumblr.com/post/359715990/you-cannot-use-it-effectively-with-one-hand-which">squashed.tumblr.com</a>, via <a href="http://www.marco.org/359754509">marco.org</a>.</cite></blockquote></p>
