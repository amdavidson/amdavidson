<p>Saw this building today when I went for a walk in Hongqiao Park, around the corner of my hotel. The architecture is do different from what one normally sees in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Most of the windows had some amount of paper covering them up and some of the pathways next to he building were boarded up.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's under renovation or just going to waste as so many buildings over here seem to.</p>
