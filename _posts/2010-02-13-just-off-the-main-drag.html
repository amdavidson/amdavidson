<p>Well, the fabric market was closed today in honor of New Years Eve, so I took a walk down Nanjing Lu.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Nanjing Lu is one of the fancy shopping streets in Shanghai, closed to cars and <em>always</em> packed with people. Wild children, window shoppers, buskers, pick pockets, it's got it all.</p>
<p>What's interesting to me, and what seems to hold true anywhere I go in China, is that it is all a thin veneer. Just past the Omega dealer and the LaCoste store, you get right back into the run-down streets of the rest of Shanghai.</p>
<p>This door caught my attention today and drew me off the main drag and back into the alleys and side streets, where there always seems to be more to see.</p>
