<p style="text-align: left;">Last night was Chinese New Years eve and I have to say, the fireworks last night were nothing short of amazing. The video above was a panning shot from my hotel room window on the 42nd floor of the Royal Meridien in downtown Shanghai. There&rsquo;s another static shot <a href="http://vimeo.com/9437089">here</a>.</p>
<p>I took a few photos as well (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4355579446/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4355580890/">here</a>) but they really don&rsquo;t do the display justice.</p>
<p>It started around 8PM when the sun had set and darkness had set in, and i just sat by the window watching and reading until the show started to die out around 1 in the morning. The sound of the explosions was a low thunderous rumble continuously through the evening and by the end of the night the smoke from all the powder had thickened the sky so much it was nearly impossible to make out the fireworks themselves, they had turned into a dull twinkling of lights across the sky.</p>
<p>If you ever have the opportunity to witness something like this, make it happen. It is definitely something I will not soon forget.</p>
<p>Happy Year of the Tiger everyone.</p>
