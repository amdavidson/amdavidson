<p>A shot of the fountains outside the Crowne Plaza hotel in Suzhou.</p>
<p>An Interesting hotel; it&#8217;s styled like a cruise ship, both inside and out. The
effect permeates everything and is quite effective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only shot I liked of the hotel was of the fountains out front.</p>
