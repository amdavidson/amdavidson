<p>Naomi and I took a nice trip down to San Luis Obispo this weekend for our engagement photos and took some time to visit all of our old spots. I took this shot of Naomi on our first morning there as she was enjoying some of Black Horse&#8217;s finest espresso-laden beverages.</p>
<p>We had a great time and <a href="http://www.christanp.com/">our photographer</a> was a lot of fun. The weather was generally wonderful, except for rain during the 2 hours of our engagement shoot. Fortunately it was expected and we were prepared, and I think the photos are going to turn out well regardless. I&#8217;ll try to get one or two posted once I get my hands on them.</p>
