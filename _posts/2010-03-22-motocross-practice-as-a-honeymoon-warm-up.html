<p>I don&#8217;t know how many people have heard, but we&#8217;re planning on doing a motorcycle tour of some of the temples around Angkor Wat while in Cambodia during the honeymoon. That all sounds fine and good until one realizes that I have never ridden anything faster than a 150cc scooter and Naomi has never driven anything with a clutch, much less a motorcycle. With that in mind we set off to Livermore with David and his family and a dirt bike borrowed from a 13 year old girl.</p>
<p>After some prep and a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4455619664/">few minutes of lessons</a> from David, Naomi took off first. <em>Well</em>&#8230; &#8220;took off&#8221; might be a little strong, she did not exactly launch out of the gate, but after a few laps around an empty parking lot she was really moving and by the end of the day she was getting a micro-second or two of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4454840621/">airtime off the jumps</a> on the beginner track!</p>
<p>It was my turn next and I think I fared fairly well. Definitely somewhere between a toddler and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Carmichael">Ricky Carmichael</a>. Tanya also took a spin on the bike and did great save for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4454840857/">one incident</a>.</p>
<p>All in all we had a great time. Even the girls had <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4454839641/">fun</a>, though were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4455620690/">not all that interested</a> in the motorcycles.</p>
<p>Thanks to David for the instructions and gear and sourcing the bike and thanks to Alex for taking a bunch of the photos while we were tooling around with the bike.</p>
