<p>I got into Lausanne last night for a one night stay to visit a vendor. I drove here from Zurich and found the drive to be quite beautiful.</p>
<p>That being said, Lausanne was no disappointment even after the beautiful drive down here. I had a few free hours in the evening so I took a walk down to Lake Geneva and took this sunset shot while down there. You can see a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/sets/72157623689294058/">few others</a> as well.</p>
