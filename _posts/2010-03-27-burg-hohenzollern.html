<p>I visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenzollern_Castle">Burg Hohenzollern</a> on my day off today, thank goodness for Germany and their stern reluctance to work on weekends.</p>
<p>One of the guys at the vendor sent me a list of things to do and one of them was to check out the Hohenzollern castle. I figured it sounded as good as any idea, being that I was in a country <em>with</em> castles, and I generally cannot say that.</p>
<p>It was a fairly quick drive from the hotel, down some fairly pretty Germany side roads through small villages and farmland. I could already see the castle up high up on a hill when I was still 10km away according to the GPS in my car.</p>
<p>I was too cheap to pay for a guided tour in German that I couldn't understand, but wandering the grounds was nice. It was smaller than I expect it to be, but it was still pretty big for a family home, even if it was for the Kings of Prussia. I posted some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/sets/72157623715480302/">other photos</a> of it that you can check out as well.</p>
