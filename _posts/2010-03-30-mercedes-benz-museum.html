<p>Not to leave a minute to waste in Deutschland I also visited the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Museum">Mercedes-Benz museum</a> on their factory campus not far from <a href="https://amdavidson.com/blog/post/481832889/porsche-factory-museum">Porsche</a> in Stuttgart.</p>
<p>I am not a rabid fan of Mercedes. I respect some of their early work, but don't really get the same thrill out of their later stuff. That might change in my septuagenerian years of life as it seems to do for many.</p>
<p>The museum was fun and interesting some of the cars were neat to see such as the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4468312612/in/set-72157623591112393/">world's first motorcycle</a> and a wonderful wedge-shaped, rotary <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4468310412/in/set-72157623591112393/">concept car</a> but all in all it was much less appealing to me than the Porsche museum.</p>
<p>If you have some extra time, or are a big fan of Daimler-Benz it's worth a couple hours. But <em>do not</em> spend any amount of euros on their simulator. You do not get to drive the cars and it is a very poor simulation of much of anything.</p>
