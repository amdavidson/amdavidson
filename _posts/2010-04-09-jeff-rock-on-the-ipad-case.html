<blockquote>I'm not even sure why I bought it in the first place. I hate cases. What I want isn't a case so much as a slip. Just something that keeps the iPad covered and clean while it's traveling. This isn't about protection so much as transportation and subtlety. It's the same reason I don't strap a bra on my car. Sure, the hood will get nicked but I'll take the dings over making a BMW look like it's on its way to an S&amp;M convention.</blockquote></p>
