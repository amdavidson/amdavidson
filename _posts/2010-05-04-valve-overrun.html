<p>Took Lucy out for a test run last night and revved the engine up to over 5k, something that I had been hesitant to do when she was in such a weak state.</p>
<p>Well, she overruns quite a bit and when you back off the throttle she dumps a big cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>Fortunately it seems to be limited to over 5k and I haven&#8217;t seen a need for that in driving her over the last week or so, so a head rebuild can wait.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good because the suspension needs a lot of work&#8230;.</p>
