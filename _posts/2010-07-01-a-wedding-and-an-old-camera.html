<p>A couple weeks ago I found a Graflex 22 at an estate sale.  Last weekend I had a wonderful opportunity to use it, the wedding of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/sets/72157624396601532">Jeff and Stacey LaBarge</a>.</p>
<p>The Graflex is an interesting piece. It is over 50 years old and doesn't look a day over 10. Don't get me wrong, you can see signs of use in the leather case, and it had a thick layer of dust. But there is no dust or fungus in the lens, the foams all look good, and the shutter seems to operate smoothly and consistently.</p>
<p>The Graflex has never had the cachet of a Rollei or Mamiya TLR, but I am impressed with this little camera. It's my first TLR, my first camera with no light meter, and my first square format camera. With all those firsts I think I managed to squeeze out a pretty <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/sets/72157624396601532">good roll</a>. I had a bit of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/4750506133/in/set-72157624396601532/">back-focusing</a> problem, I'm going to need to do some bright daylight trials to see if that's operator error or not.</p>
<p>The wedding went off without a hitch, they had a great ceremony in a beautiful part of the state. It was great to be a part of it and I wish Jeff and Stacey the best in their new lives together.</p>
