<p>I happened upon this one night when coming home for dinner.</p>
<p>It was dress rehearsal for a 2011 Porsche Cayenne reveal party that was happening in conjunction with the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau International Auto Show.</p>
<p>The rehearsal seemed appropriately ugly and childish, given the ugly, cutesy redesign of the Cayenne.</p>
