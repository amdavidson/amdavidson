<p>Here's a shot of the Windows of the World amusement park in Nanshan, Shenzhen.</p>
<p>I changed my travel plans yesterday to return home early. There just wasn't enough work over here to
warrant me staying. This marks the first time that has ever happened.</p>
<p>As usual I stayed up all night in an attempt to get some sleep on the plane and head off a bit of
the jet lag. Wish me luck with that as there is plenty of work to be done back home.</p>
