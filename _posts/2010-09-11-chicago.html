<p>Over labor day, Naomi and I went to visit Kyle in Chicago. Just a quick three day trip to see a city that neither of us had ever been to.</p>
<p>Great food, cool sights to see, and wonderful weather all lead to us have a great time in the city. I'd love to go back.</p>
<p>About 4 hours before takeoff, I got my hands on a new iPhone 4 and decided to put the camera through it's paces a little. I posted the shots I took on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amdavidson/sets/72157624927613034/">Flickr</a><br />
with zero editing and really very little effort going into each one. I'm rather impressed with the quality and think that with a little bit of work it could take some really great stuff. I'm also curious to see what the new HDR photos look like with the firmware that came out this week (and after the trip).</p>
