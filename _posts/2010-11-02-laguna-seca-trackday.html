<p>I took a PTO day and went to Laguna Seca with Alex for a track day of his.</p>
<p>There were a couple cool vintage cars having a day of it and it really made me want to work on my 2002.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I brought a camera with dead batteries, so I didn't manage to get a photo of the 2002 Roundie that was there, but I did manage to get one shot of this 66 Mustang before the batteries totally died.</p>
