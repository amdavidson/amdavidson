<p>Well, tomorrow will mark my last day at Apple. The last two and a half years have been an incredible experience. Interesting, educational, exasperating, and still hard for me to believe. I think it will be a long time before I've fully processed all the experiences I've had working at Apple, but that processing can begin as my days at Apple have come to a close.</p>
<p>A great opportunity came up with <a href="http://bloomenergy.com">Bloom Energy</a> so I'm moving from Apple and consumer electronics to Bloom and green energy. It's an interesting company with an even more interesting product. For those of you who aren't familiar with Bloom's fuel cells from the recent news coverage <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6221135.shtml">here</a> is the feature that 60 Minutes did on Bloom Energy. If that doesn't satisfy you there's a bunch more links on the Bloom Energy <a href="http://bloomenergy.com/news/">news page</a>.</p>
<p>I will look back fondly on the projects I worked on and people I worked with at Apple, but I am very excited to see where this new adventure will lead me.</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
