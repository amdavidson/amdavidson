<p>The iPad 2 is released.</p>
<p>This was, basically, the final product I worked on in my tenure at Apple.</p>
<p>It's a great way to have closed out that period in my career. It's a wonderful product and refines the iPad in a great many ways that were due for refining without a single drawback that I have discovered in a few days of use.</p>
<p>If you have an iPad, it's not an upgrade that will make you go running for a new one. If you don't have an iPad it's a wonderful piece of kit that really helps to define the use case of the iPad. It's more comfortable to hold and use, in great part due to the wonderfully clever Smart Cover. Big kudos to the team that worked so hard on that product.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to find my way to the front of the line at the Palo Alto Apple Store for the launch, and was the first customer out of the store with an iPad 2 on Friday. The experience was great to be a part of, both on the side of an engineer that worked on the iPad 2 program and as a customer who was genuinely excited to buy one. Definitely an experience that I will not be able to repeat.</p>
<p>To those of you still at Apple, keep at it, keep making the great products I know you can, and I'll find a way to the front of many more lines. I can't wait to see where you take this product line that I have so much vested in.</p>
