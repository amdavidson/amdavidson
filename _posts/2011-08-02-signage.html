<p>While taking a walk around Mare Island, I was especially taken with the signage that was left over from its days as a shipyard. The handcrafted style and vintage lettering was fun to see in an age of bland, pre-fab plastic signs that we usually see in industrial sites.</p>

<p>Enjoy the signs.</p>
