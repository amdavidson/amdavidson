<p>3 guys, 44 days, 11 countries, 18 flights, 38 thousand miles, an exploding volcano, 2 cameras and almost a terabyte of footage... all to turn 3 ambitious linear concepts based on movement, learning and food ....into 3 beautiful and hopefully compelling short films.....</p>
<p>A one minute spectacular. Part of a three part series, watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/27243869">eat</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/27244727">learn</a> as well. Learn brought memories back as they visit the same <a href="http://peru.chocomuseo.com/p/museum.html">Choco Museo</a> that we visited in Peru and there is a fleeting shot of one of the guys who helped us through our class as well.</p>
