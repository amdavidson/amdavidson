<p>This has to be one of the funniest things I've seen in a while. A designer named <a href="http://www.chrisherrondesign.com/hell.html">Chris Herron</a> put an astounding amount of work into a theoretical redesign for Hell at the request of the "Hell Office of Travel and Tourism".</p>
<blockquote><p>As the premier global tourist destination, Hell provides a one of a kind experience for the visitor. We take great pains to accommodate your every desire. You will experience pure pleasure from our luxurious hotels and resorts, exciting gaming venues, unparalleled nightlife, and world-class entertainment. Not to mention our top-notch convention facilities. Hell is Simply Heavenly.</blockquote></p>
<p>Definitely a <a href="http://www.chrisherrondesign.com/hell.html">must read</a>.</p>
