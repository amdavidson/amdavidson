<blockquote>Here's a thought: geofence based calendar alerts. If my meeting is at my office, and I too am in my office, set the alert to only 5 minutes before. If I am at home and my meeting is at work, set alert for 15 minutes before.</p>
<p>That would be cool, and that would be helpful.</blockquote></p>

<p>I would happily pay for this app. I hope one of the guys who made Agenda or Calvetica takes note.</p>
