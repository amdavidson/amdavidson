<p>Took a few photos today in the Architecture Graveyard that is nestled in Cal Poly's Poly Canyon.</p>
<p>I had recently seen a project that I had worked on in college sitting rusty in a yard and it's a shame to see these projects of much larger scale going into such disrepair. It must have been something to see these structures in their prime in the sixties and seventies.</p>
