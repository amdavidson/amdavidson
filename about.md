My name is Andrew Davidson and you&#8217;ve reached my personal slice of the web. This site has been around in various forms since February of 2005 and allows me to post things to share with the world.

You can also find me elsewhere on the web. Outside of this domain I occasionally save links at <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:amdavidson">Pinboard</a> and post 140 character musings at <a href="http://twitter.com/amdavidson">Twitter</a>

You can shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:hello@amdavidson.com">hello@amdavidson.com</a> to get ahold of me privately.
